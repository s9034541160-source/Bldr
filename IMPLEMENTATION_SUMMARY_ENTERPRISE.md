# SuperBuilder Enterprise Mode Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation provides a complete enterprise-mode model configuration and management system for SuperBuilder with the following features:
- Exact model configurations based on roles.txt specifications
- LRU cache with max 12 models and 30-minute TTL
- Priority-based preloading for high-priority roles
- Usage statistics tracking
- Real Ollama client integration with fallback to mock clients
- Integration with trainer.py and coordinator.py

## Files Implemented

### 1. config/models_config.py
- **Exact model configurations** for all roles from roles.txt:
  - coordinator: DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, temp=0.1, timeout=10800
  - chief_engineer: qwen2.5-vl-7b, temp=0.4
  - structural_engineer: deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528-qwen3-8b, temp=0.3
  - geotechnical_engineer: deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528-qwen3-8b, temp=0.3
  - project_manager: deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528-qwen3-8b, temp=0.3
  - construction_worker: deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528-qwen3-8b, temp=0.3
  - quality_control_officer: deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528-qwen3-8b, temp=0.3
  - analyst: deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528-qwen3-8b, temp=0.3
- **Detailed role specifications** including:
  - Responsibilities
  - Exclusions
  - FACTUAL_ACCURACY_RULES
  - Tool instructions
- **Model priorities** for preloading (coordinator=10, chief_engineer=8, etc.)

### 2. core/model_manager.py
- **LRU cache implementation** with max 12 models and 30-minute TTL
- **Priority-based preloading** for roles with priority >= 7
- **Real Ollama client integration** with base_url='http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1'
- **Graceful fallback** to mock clients when Ollama is unavailable
- **Usage statistics tracking** for loaded models, hours, and usage counts
- **get_capabilities_prompt()** method for role-specific prompts
- **query()** method for model interaction
- **Robust error handling** and import management

### 3. core/trainer.py
- **ModelManager initialization** with MODELS_CONFIG
- **Integration** with coordinator.process_request() → model_manager.query(role, messages)
- **Training functionality** for role-specific models
- **Statistics retrieval** for model usage monitoring
- **Preloading capabilities** for specified roles

### 4. tests/model_manager_test.py
- **Comprehensive test suite** with specific assertions:
  - preload(['coordinator']) len(loaded)==2
  - stats usage after query
- **Test coverage** for all major functionality:
  - Model initialization
  - Priority preloading
  - LRU cache eviction
  - TTL expiration
  - Statistics tracking
  - Capabilities prompts
  - Query functionality

## Key Features Implemented

### LRU Cache Management
- Maximum 12 concurrently loaded models
- 30-minute TTL for loaded models
- Automatic eviction of least recently used models
- Time-based expiration of stale models

### Priority-Based Preloading
- High-priority roles (priority >= 7) preloaded at startup
- coordinator (priority 10) and chief_engineer (priority 8) preloaded
- Improved response times for critical roles

### Usage Statistics
- Track loaded models count
- Monitor hours each model has been loaded
- Count usage frequency for each role
- Detailed per-model statistics

### Real Implementation
- No stubs or mock-only implementations
- Full preload/LRU/stats/query functionality
- Real Ollama clients with base_url='http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1'
- Proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

## Integration Points

### With Coordinator
- coordinator.process_request() integrated with model_manager.query(role, messages)
- Role-based model selection for specialized tasks
- Capability prompts for role-specific behavior

### With Trainer
- self.model_manager = ModelManager(MODELS_CONFIG) initialization
- Direct access to all model management features
- Training and querying capabilities

## Testing Verification

All tests pass successfully, verifying:
- ✅ Priority preloading loads at least 2 models (coordinator + chief_engineer)
- ✅ Usage statistics are properly tracked after queries
- ✅ LRU cache correctly evicts models when exceeding max size
- ✅ TTL properly expires models after time limits
- ✅ All roles have proper capability prompts
- ✅ ModelManager integrates correctly with trainer.py
- ✅ Real Ollama clients work with fallback to mock clients

## Requirements Met

This implementation fully satisfies all requirements from the original request:
- ✅ config/models_config.py with exact model configurations
- ✅ core/model_manager.py with preload_priority, LRU cache, TTL, stats
- ✅ Integration with trainer.py initialization and coordinator.process_request()
- ✅ Real Ollama clients with no stubs
- ✅ tests/model_manager_test.py with specific assertions
- ✅ Full preload/LRU/stats/query functionality
