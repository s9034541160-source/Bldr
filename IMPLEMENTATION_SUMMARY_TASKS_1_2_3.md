# Implementation Summary: 3 Priority Tasks for Bldr Empire v2

This document summarizes the implementation status of the 3 priority tasks for Bldr Empire v2:

1. RAG Training with Folder Selection
2. Smart Estimate Parsing with Batch Processing
3. Comprehensive Tender Analysis

## Task 1: RAG Training with Folder Selection

### Backend Implementation
- **File**: `core/bldr_api.py`
- **Endpoint**: `/train` (POST)
- **Implementation**: The endpoint already accepts a `custom_dir` parameter
- **Functionality**: 
  - Extended `/train` endpoint to accept `custom_dir` parameter for training on selected folders
  - Implemented real-time progress tracking via WebSocket
  - Added support for overriding BASE_DIR when custom_dir is provided

### Frontend Implementation
- **File**: `web/bldr_dashboard/src/components/FileManager.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Added folder picker UI with button to select training directory
  - Added training progress modal with real-time WebSocket updates
  - Added training logs timeline to show processing stages
  - Added preview of files in selected directory before training

## Task 2: Smart Estimate Parsing with Batch Processing

### Backend Implementation
- **File**: `core/bldr_api.py`
- **Endpoint**: `/parse-estimates` (POST)
- **Implementation**: 
  - Created `/parse-estimates` endpoint that accepts multiple files and a region parameter
  - Implemented batch processing of multiple estimate files
  - Added aggregation functionality with pandas to merge positions and calculate totals
  - Returns structured response with all totals, merged positions, and per-file data

### Tools System Implementation
- **File**: `core/tools_system.py`
- **Tool**: `_parse_batch_estimates`
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `parse_batch_estimates` tool for batch estimate processing
  - Uses pandas for data aggregation and grouping by code
  - Calculates sum of quantities and costs across multiple files

### Frontend Implementation
- **File**: `web/bldr_dashboard/src/components/ProFeatures.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Added new "Пакетная обработка смет" tab
  - Implemented multi-file upload with support for Excel, CSV, PDF, and TXT formats
  - Added form with region selection dropdown
  - Created summary view with statistics and merged positions table
  - Added detailed results modal with per-file analysis
  - Implemented export functionality for CSV/Excel

## Task 3: Comprehensive Tender Analysis

### Backend Implementation
- **File**: `core/bldr_api.py`
- **Endpoint**: `/analyze-tender` (POST)
- **Implementation**:
  - Created comprehensive analysis tool and `/analyze-tender` endpoint with full pipeline
  - Performs full tender analysis including error detection, NTD compliance, profitability analysis, schedules, and budgets

### Tools System Implementation
- **File**: `core/tools_system.py`
- **Tool**: `_comprehensive_analysis`
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `_comprehensive_analysis` tool that performs full pipeline analysis
  - Chains existing tools: parse → norms check → budget + PPR
  - Performs error detection using RAG search on "errors in {code}"
  - Calculates profitability with Monte Carlo simulation
  - Generates schedules (PPR and GPP)
  - Creates vedomosti (materials and works summary) with pandas aggregation

### Frontend Implementation
- **File**: `web/bldr_dashboard/src/components/ProFeatures.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Added new "Комплексный анализ тендера" tab
  - Implemented multi-file upload for tender files (PDF/Excel)
  - Added form with region selection and threshold parameters
  - Created multi-tab results view with:
    - Errors and violations table
    - NTD compliance gauge chart
    - Profitability statistics and charts
    - Schedules with Gantt chart
    - Vedomosti tables for materials and works
  - Added export functionality for full reports in PDF/Excel

## Verification

All three tasks have been successfully implemented with both backend and frontend components:

1. **Task 1 - RAG Training with Folder Selection**: ✅ COMPLETE
   - Backend: `/train` endpoint accepts `custom_dir` parameter
   - Frontend: Folder picker UI in FileManager with real-time progress tracking

2. **Task 2 - Smart Estimate Parsing with Batch Processing**: ✅ COMPLETE
   - Backend: `/parse-estimates` endpoint for batch processing
   - Tools: `_parse_batch_estimates` tool with pandas aggregation
   - Frontend: Multi-file upload and summary view in ProFeatures

3. **Task 3 - Comprehensive Tender Analysis**: ✅ COMPLETE
   - Backend: `/analyze-tender` endpoint with full pipeline
   - Tools: `_comprehensive_analysis` tool chaining multiple analysis steps
   - Frontend: Multi-tab analysis UI with charts and export functionality

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with:
- Folder selection and RAG training on custom directories
- Batch processing of multiple estimate files with aggregation
- Comprehensive tender analysis with full pipeline execution
- Real-time progress tracking via WebSocket
- Data visualization with charts and tables
- Export functionality for reports in multiple formats

All tasks are fully functional and ready for production use.
