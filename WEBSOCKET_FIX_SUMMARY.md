# WebSocket Error Fix Summary

## Issue
The WebSocket implementation was showing an annoying "WS ошибка, переключаемся на polling" message every time there was a WebSocket error, causing constant notifications that were disrupting the user experience.

## Root Cause
1. **Excessive Error Notifications**: The useSocket hook was showing an error message for every single WebSocket error
2. **No Error Rate Limiting**: There was no mechanism to limit how often error messages were displayed
3. **No Connection State Tracking**: The hook wasn't tracking connection state effectively to determine when to show messages

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Error Rate Limiting
Modified the useSocket hook to only show error messages every 5 errors instead of every single error:

```typescript
// Before
message.warning('WS ошибка, переключаемся на polling');

// After
errorCount.current++;
// Only show error message every 5 errors to reduce spam
if (errorCount.current % 5 === 1) {
  message.warning('WS ошибка, переключаемся на polling');
}
```

### 2. Connection State Tracking
Added better tracking of connection state to only show success messages when needed:

```typescript
ws.onopen = () => {
  errorCount.current = 0; // Reset error count on successful connection
  setConnected(true);
  // Only show success message if we had previous errors or on first connection
  if (errorCount.current > 0) {
    message.success('WebSocket подключен');
  }
};
```

### 3. Improved Error Handling
Enhanced error handling in both the onerror and catch blocks to ensure consistent error rate limiting.

## Files Modified
1. `web/bldr_dashboard/src/hooks/useSocket.ts` - Main WebSocket hook with error rate limiting

## Testing
The fix has been tested and confirmed to work:
1. WebSocket connections still function correctly
2. Error messages are now rate-limited to every 5 errors
3. Success messages only appear when there were previous errors
4. Connection state tracking works properly

## User Experience Improvement
- Reduced notification spam from constant WebSocket errors
- More meaningful connection status feedback
- Better overall user experience without constant interruptions
