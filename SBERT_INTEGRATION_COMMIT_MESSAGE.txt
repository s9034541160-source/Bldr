feat: sbert_nlu_ru-integration

Integrated ai-forever/sbert_large_nlu_ru model for enhanced Russian language understanding in Bldr Empire v2:

- Added parse_utils.py with SBERT-based intent classification and entity extraction
- Updated config.py with semantic_parse tool instructions for all roles
- Enhanced tools_system.py with semantic_parse tool and SBERT support in search_rag_database
- Integrated SBERT parsing results into coordinator.py for better plan generation
- Created comprehensive test suite (test_sbert_parse.py, test_sbert_e2e.py)
- Added automatic detection of Russian construction terms (СП, ГЭСН, ФЗ, ГОСТ, СНиП, СанПиН)
- Implemented fallback to Nomic embeddings when SBERT is not suitable
- Enhanced entity dictionary for construction domain terms
- Added E2E checklist rows for SBERT functionality
- Improved RAG search accuracy for Russian queries using SBERT embeddings
- Local processing with no cloud dependency (~2GB RAM usage)

This integration significantly improves the system's accuracy for Russian construction terminology, enhancing intent classification, entity extraction, and semantic search capabilities.
