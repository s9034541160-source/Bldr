# Bldr Empire v2 Service Startup Fix Summary

## Issue
The "one-click" start functionality was not actually starting all required services properly:
1. [one_click_start.bat](file:///c%3A/Bldr/one_click_start.bat) was starting uvicorn directly instead of using [start_backend.bat](file:///c%3A/Bldr/start_backend.bat)
2. Celery services (worker and beat) were not being started by the one-click script
3. The one-click stop script wasn't properly stopping all services

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated [one_click_start.bat](file:///c%3A/Bldr/one_click_start.bat)
- Replaced direct uvicorn startup with calling [start_backend.bat](file:///c%3A/Bldr/start_backend.bat)
- Added startup of Celery worker and beat services
- Maintained all existing functionality (dashboard, Telegram bot, etc.)

### 2. Updated [start_backend.bat](file:///c%3A/Bldr/start_backend.bat)
- Added startup of Celery worker and beat services
- Kept existing Redis and API server startup
- Removed the `pause` command to allow proper background operation

### 3. Updated [start_celery.bat](file:///c%3A/Bldr/start_celery.bat) and [start_celery_beat.bat](file:///c%3A/Bldr/start_celery_beat.bat)
- Removed the `pause` command to allow proper background operation
- Maintained all other functionality

### 4. Updated [one_click_stop.bat](file:///c%3A/Bldr/one_click_stop.bat)
- Added killing of Celery-related processes by window title
- Improved process cleanup

### 5. Updated [start_all_services.bat](file:///c%3A/Bldr/start_all_services.bat)
- Fixed path references to be consistent
- Ensured proper background operation

## Verification
Created [test_one_click_start.py](file:///c%3A/Bldr/test_one_click_start.py) to verify all services start correctly:
- API server on port 8000
- Health check endpoint
- Redis server on port 6379
- Redis connectivity
- Celery workers

## Result
The one-click start functionality now properly starts all required services in the background:
1. Redis server
2. Celery worker
3. Celery beat
4. FastAPI backend (uvicorn)
5. React frontend dashboard
6. Telegram bot

All services can be stopped with the one-click stop script.
