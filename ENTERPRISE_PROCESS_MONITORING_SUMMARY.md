# Enterprise Process Monitoring System Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the enterprise-grade process monitoring system for Bldr Empire v2. The system provides live process monitoring, comprehensive retry mechanisms, and process status APIs with real-time WebSocket updates.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Process Tracker System (`core/process_tracker.py`)

A unified process tracking system that can monitor different types of operations:

- **Process Types**: AI tasks, RAG training, document processing, scheduled tasks, background jobs, tools execution
- **Process Statuses**: Pending, Running, Completed, Failed, Cancelled, Timeout
- **Real-time WebSocket Updates**: Broadcasts process updates to all connected clients
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Periodically removes completed processes to prevent memory leaks
- **Metadata Tracking**: Stores custom metadata for each process

### 2. Retry System (`core/retry_system.py`)

A centralized retry mechanism with exponential backoff for failed processes:

- **Configurable Retry Policies**: Different retry configurations for different process types
- **Exponential Backoff**: Increases delay between retry attempts
- **Jitter Support**: Adds randomness to retry delays to prevent thundering herd
- **Retry Tracking**: Monitors retry attempts and reports status
- **Automatic Scheduling**: Schedules retries automatically when processes fail

### 3. API Endpoints (`core/bldr_api.py`)

RESTful API endpoints for process management:

- **List Processes**: `/processes` - List all tracked processes with filtering
- **Get Process**: `/processes/{process_id}` - Get status of a specific process
- **Cancel Process**: `/processes/{process_id}/cancel` - Cancel a running process
- **Process Types**: `/processes/types` - Get available process types
- **Process Statuses**: `/processes/statuses` - Get available process statuses

### 4. WebSocket Endpoint (`core/bldr_api.py`)

Real-time WebSocket endpoint for process updates:

- **Endpoint**: `/ws/processes` - WebSocket connection for real-time process updates
- **Authentication**: Supports token-based authentication with SKIP_AUTH option
- **Broadcast Updates**: Sends updates to all connected clients

### 5. Integration with Existing Systems

#### Async AI Processor (`core/async_ai_processor.py`)
- Integrated process tracking with AI task execution
- Real-time progress updates during AI processing
- Status tracking from pending to completion/failure

#### Background RAG Training (`background_rag_training.py`)
- Process tracking for RAG training operations
- Progress monitoring with detailed statistics
- Error handling and status reporting

## Key Features

### Live Process Monitoring
- Real-time WebSocket updates for all process changes
- Unified interface for monitoring different operation types
- Progress tracking with percentage completion
- Detailed metadata and error information

### Comprehensive Retry System
- Configurable retry policies for different process types
- Exponential backoff with jitter to prevent resource contention
- Automatic retry scheduling when processes fail
- Retry status tracking and monitoring

### Process Status API
- RESTful endpoints for querying process information
- Filtering by process type and status
- Detailed process metadata and error tracking
- Process cancellation capabilities

### Enterprise-Grade Design
- Thread-safe operations with proper concurrency control
- Memory management with automatic cleanup
- Error handling with detailed logging
- Scalable architecture supporting thousands of concurrent processes

## Usage Examples

### Tracking an AI Task
```python
from core.process_tracker import get_process_tracker, ProcessType, ProcessStatus

process_tracker = get_process_tracker()

# Start tracking a process
process_id = "ai_task_12345"
process_tracker.start_process(
    process_id=process_id,
    process_type=ProcessType.AI_TASK,
    name="Document Analysis",
    description="Analyzing construction document for compliance",
    metadata={"document_id": "doc_abc123", "model": "deepseek-r1"}
)

# Update process status
process_tracker.update_process(
    process_id,
    status=ProcessStatus.RUNNING,
    progress=50,
    metadata_update={"stage": "processing"}
)

# Complete process
process_tracker.update_process(
    process_id,
    status=ProcessStatus.COMPLETED,
    progress=100,
    metadata_update={"result": "Compliance check passed"}
)
```

### Configuring Retry Policies
```python
from core.retry_system import get_retry_system, RetryConfig

retry_system = get_retry_system()

# Configure retry policy for AI tasks
retry_system.register_retry_config(
    "ai_task", 
    RetryConfig(
        max_attempts=3,
        initial_delay=1.0,
        max_delay=60.0,
        exponential_base=2.0,
        jitter=True
    )
)
```

### API Usage
```bash
# List all processes
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8000/processes

# Get specific process
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8000/processes/ai_task_12345

# Cancel process
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8000/processes/ai_task_12345/cancel
```

## WebSocket Updates

The system broadcasts JSON updates via WebSocket with the following structure:

```json
{
  "type": "process_update",
  "process_id": "ai_task_12345",
  "process_type": "ai_task",
  "status": "running",
  "name": "Document Analysis",
  "progress": 75,
  "message": "AI processing in progress... 2 minutes elapsed",
  "timestamp": 1700000000.123,
  "metadata": {
    "stage": "processing",
    "elapsed_minutes": 2
  }
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Unified Monitoring**: Single interface for monitoring all system operations
2. **Real-time Updates**: Instant feedback on process status changes
3. **Automatic Recovery**: Built-in retry mechanisms for failed operations
4. **Scalable Design**: Handles thousands of concurrent processes efficiently
5. **Enterprise-Ready**: Production-grade error handling and logging
6. **Easy Integration**: Simple API for integrating with existing systems

## Future Enhancements

1. **Process Dependencies**: Support for dependent processes that execute in sequence
2. **Resource Monitoring**: Track CPU, memory, and disk usage for each process
3. **Alerting System**: Notifications for process failures or performance issues
4. **Historical Analytics**: Long-term storage and analysis of process performance
5. **Dashboard UI**: Web-based dashboard for monitoring processes in real-time

## Conclusion

The enterprise process monitoring system provides a robust foundation for tracking and managing all operations within Bldr Empire v2. With real-time updates, automatic retries, and comprehensive API access, it enables better visibility and control over system processes while maintaining enterprise-grade reliability and scalability.
