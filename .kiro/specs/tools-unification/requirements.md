# Requirements Document - Tools System Unification

## Introduction

This specification defines the unification of the Bldr Empire v2 tools system to create a consistent, flexible, and maintainable architecture for all 47+ construction tools. The goal is to standardize API interfaces, eliminate parameter validation complexity, and prepare for tool consolidation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Unified Tool Execution Interface

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single, consistent interface for executing any tool, so that I can easily integrate new tools and maintain existing ones.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tool is executed THEN the system SHALL use **kwargs for parameter passing
2. WHEN a tool receives parameters THEN the system SHALL only pass non-None values
3. WHEN a tool is called THEN the system SHALL return a standardized response format
4. WHEN parameter validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 2: Standardized Response Format

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want consistent response formats from all tools, so that I can build reliable UI components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any tool executes successfully THEN the response SHALL include status: "success"
2. WHEN any tool fails THEN the response SHALL include status: "error" and error message
3. WHEN a tool returns data THEN the response SHALL include a "data" field
4. WHEN a tool generates files THEN the response SHALL include "files" array with paths
5. WHEN a tool has metadata THEN the response SHALL include "metadata" object

### Requirement 3: Parameter Flexibility

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want flexible parameter passing, so that tools can accept varying numbers of parameters without breaking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tool is called with extra parameters THEN the system SHALL ignore unused parameters
2. WHEN a tool is called with missing optional parameters THEN the system SHALL use defaults
3. WHEN a tool requires specific parameters THEN the system SHALL validate only required ones
4. WHEN parameters are passed THEN the system SHALL preserve original data types

### Requirement 4: Tool Discovery and Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automatic tool discovery and documentation, so that I can understand available tools and their parameters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL automatically discover all available tools
2. WHEN tool documentation is requested THEN the system SHALL provide parameter descriptions
3. WHEN tool capabilities are queried THEN the system SHALL return tool categories and features
4. WHEN new tools are added THEN they SHALL be automatically included in discovery

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Retry Logic

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want robust error handling and retry capabilities, so that temporary failures don't break workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a tool fails due to temporary issues THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times
2. WHEN a tool fails permanently THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
3. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff
4. WHEN dependencies are missing THEN the system SHALL provide installation guidance

### Requirement 6: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want fast tool execution, so that my workflows are not slowed down by system overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tools are executed THEN parameter validation SHALL complete in <10ms
2. WHEN multiple tools run THEN the system SHALL support parallel execution
3. WHEN tools are loaded THEN the system SHALL cache frequently used components
4. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL implement cleanup strategies

### Requirement 7: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want my current tool integrations to continue working, so that I don't need to update all my code immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN legacy parameter formats are used THEN the system SHALL convert them automatically
2. WHEN old API endpoints are called THEN they SHALL continue to work with deprecation warnings
3. WHEN response formats change THEN legacy formats SHALL be supported for 6 months
4. WHEN tools are renamed THEN aliases SHALL be maintained for backward compatibility
