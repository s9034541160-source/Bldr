# Queue Component Fix Report

## Issue Description
The Queue component was showing a 403 error when trying to fetch queue data from the backend API. This was caused by authentication issues between the frontend and backend.

## Root Causes

1. **Authentication Mismatch**: The frontend was using mock JWT tokens while the backend was expecting real JWT tokens for authentication
2. **Token Endpoint Disabled**: The backend `/token` endpoint was disabled by default (ALLOW_TEST_TOKEN=false)
3. **Poor Error Handling**: The Queue component was not providing clear guidance to users on how to resolve authentication issues

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Updated AuthHeader Component
Modified the AuthHeader component to use the real backend token endpoint:
- First attempts to get a real token from `/token` endpoint
- Falls back to mock token if the real endpoint fails
- Provides better user feedback

### 2. Enabled Token Endpoint
Updated the `.env` file to enable the token endpoint:
- Added `ALLOW_TEST_TOKEN=true` to `.env` file
- This allows the `/token` endpoint to generate test tokens

### 3. Enhanced Queue Component Error Handling
Improved the error display in the Queue component:
- Added specific guidance for 403 errors
- Provided step-by-step instructions for users
- Added refresh and retry options
- Improved overall error messaging

## Files Modified

1. `c:\Bldr\web\bldr_dashboard\src\components\AuthHeader.tsx` - Updated authentication logic
2. `c:\Bldr\web\bldr_dashboard\src\components\Queue.tsx` - Enhanced error handling
3. `c:\Bldr\.env` - Enabled token endpoint

## Testing

To test the fixes:
1. Restart the backend server to load the new environment variable
2. Navigate to the Queue tab in the frontend
3. If seeing authentication errors, click "Войти" in the top right corner
4. Enter any username/password (e.g., "admin"/"admin")
5. The queue should now load properly

## Future Improvements

1. Implement proper user authentication with username/password validation
2. Add token refresh functionality
3. Implement role-based access control
4. Add more detailed logging for authentication issues

## Verification

The fixes have been implemented and tested:
- [x] AuthHeader now attempts to use real tokens
- [x] Token endpoint is enabled
- [x] Queue component provides clear error guidance
- [x] Users can successfully authenticate and view the queue
