   - Added file management capabilities (upload, scan, remove)

2. **web/bldr_dashboard/src/components/ProFeatures.tsx**
   - Integrated project selection dropdowns in all tools
   - Implemented auto-loading of files and data from projects
   - Added result saving functionality to projects

3. **web/bldr_dashboard/src/services/api.ts**
   - Extended API service with project file and result methods
   - Enhanced TypeScript interfaces for better type safety

4. **core/projects_api.py**
   - Enhanced with full CRUD operations
   - Added file handling and scanning capabilities
   - Implemented result management endpoints

## Key Improvements

### User Experience
- Users can now fully manage projects with edit/delete capabilities

- Seamless integration between projects and all Pro-Tools
- Automatic data loading reduces manual input requirements

### Technical Implementation
- Proper error handling for all project operations
- File type detection based on content and extensions
- Integration with Neo4j for persistent storage
- RESTful API design following best practices

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite:
- **tests/project_integration_test.py**: End-to-end tests for project functionality

## Documentation

Created detailed documentation:
- **PROJECT_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md**: Complete guide to using project features
- **PROJECT_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md**: Technical implementation summary
- **README.md**: Updated with project integration information

## Verification

All implemented features have been verified to work correctly:
- ✅ Project creation, editing, and deletion
- ✅ File attachment and management
- ✅ File scanning and categorization
- ✅ Pro-Tools integration with auto-loading
- ✅ Result saving and retrieval
- ✅ Error handling for all operations

## How to Use

### Managing Projects
1. Navigate to the "Projects" tab
2. Create a new project using the "Создать проект" button
3. Click on any project to open its details view
4. Use the edit button to modify project details
5. Use the delete button to remove projects

### Attaching Files to Projects
1. Open a project's details view
2. Go to the "Файлы" tab
3. Click "Выбрать файлы" to select files from your computer
4. Click "Прикрепить файлы" to upload them to the project
5. Use "Сканировать проект" to categorize files

### Using Projects with Pro-Tools
1. Navigate to any Pro-Tool (Batch Estimate, Budget, Tender Analysis, etc.)
2. Select a project from the "Проект" dropdown
3. The tool will automatically load relevant files from the project
4. Run the tool as usual
5. Click "Сохранить в проект" to save results to the project

## File Type Detection

The system automatically detects file types based on:
- **Smeta files**: Excel files (.xlsx, .xls) containing "ГЭСН" 
- **RD files**: PDF files (.pdf) containing "РД"
- **Graph files**: Microsoft Project files (.mpp) or Gantt files

## API Endpoints

The enhanced project system uses the following API endpoints:

- `POST /projects` - Create a new project
- `GET /projects` - List all projects
- `GET /projects/{id}` - Get a specific project
- `PUT /projects/{id}` - Update a project
- `DELETE /projects/{id}` - Delete a project
- `POST /projects/{id}/files` - Add files to a project
- `GET /projects/{id}/files` - Get project files
- `DELETE /projects/{id}/files/{file_id}` - Delete a file from a project
- `GET /projects/{id}/scan` - Scan and categorize project files
- `POST /projects/{id}/results` - Save tool results to a project
- `GET /projects/{id}/results` - Get project results

## Requirements

- Neo4j database (for project data storage)
- File system access (for file storage)

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for future development:
1. Bulk project operations (bulk delete, bulk file upload)
2. Advanced project search and filtering
3. Project templates for common project types
4. Enhanced file preview capabilities
5. Project collaboration features (user permissions, sharing)

## Conclusion

The project integration implementation successfully addresses the user's requirements for enhanced project management and seamless integration with Pro-Tools. Users can now efficiently manage projects, attach relevant files, and use Pro-Tools with automatic data loading and result saving capabilities.

This implementation maintains the existing system architecture while adding significant new functionality that enhances the overall user experience and workflow efficiency.
