# Bldr Empire v2 - Implementation Status

## Current State

### Frontend
- Running on http://localhost:3001/
- Using React 18 + Vite + TypeScript + Ant Design 5 + Recharts
- Current components:
  - ControlPanel
  - AIShell
  - DBTools
  - BotControl
  - FileManager
  - Analytics
  - RAGModule
  - ProFeatures

### Backend
- Running on http://localhost:8000/
- Using FastAPI with Neo4j and Qdrant
- Current endpoints:
  - /health
  - /query
  - /train
  - /metrics (Prometheus)
  - /metrics-json (JSON - added by me)
  - /ai
  - /db
  - /bot
  - /files-scan
  - /upload-file
  - And various tool endpoints

## Issues Identified

1. **No Authentication**: The application is open to everyone without login
2. **RAG Training**: No folder selection option, uses default directory
3. **Mocks**: Some components still use hardcoded/mock data instead of real API calls
4. **No Project Management**: No CRUD operations for projects
5. **No Queue Management**: No visibility into training/processing tasks
6. **No Settings**: No configurable parameters for RAG or other components
7. **No Dark Theme**: Only light theme available
8. **No Analytics**: Limited analytics capabilities
9. **No Bot Control**: Limited bot management features
10. **No Pro Feature Locking**: All features available to all users

## Implementation Plan

Following the detailed plan provided, I will implement the features in priority order:

### High Priority (4-5 days)
1. Authentication and User Management - **IN PROGRESS**
2. Project Management (CRUD) - **IN PROGRESS**
3. RAG Training Control with folder selection
4. Batch Estimate Parsing

### Medium Priority (2-3 days)
5. Queue Management - **IN PROGRESS**
6. Settings Panel - **IN PROGRESS**
7. Dark Theme Toggle - **IN PROGRESS**

### Low Priority (1-2 days)
8. Analytics Dashboard
9. Bot Control
10. Pro Feature Locking

## Progress Tracking

### Completed Tasks
- Installed required frontend dependencies (zustand, react-router-dom, @tanstack/react-query, react-dropzone, zod, react-hook-form, @ant-design/pro-components)
- Installed required backend dependencies (celery[redis], fastapi-users[jwt], jose[cryptography], bcrypt)
- Installed testing dependencies (cypress, @testing-library/react, @testing-library/jest-dom, @types/jest)
- Created Zustand store for state management with user, theme, settings, and projects
- Updated App.tsx with new layout and navigation
- Created AuthHeader component with login/logout functionality
- Created Projects component with CRUD operations
- Created Queue component with task management
- Created Settings component with configuration options
- Updated README with documentation
- Verified backend API endpoints (health, metrics working; query requires auth)
- Created comprehensive progress summary documentation

### In Progress Tasks
- Implementing authentication with JWT tokens
- Setting up Celery for task queue management
- Configuring Neo4j nodes for User, Project, Task, Config, Preset, QueryLog
- Implementing real-time updates with Socket.io
- Creating E2E tests with Cypress

### Next Steps
1. Implement JWT authentication in backend
2. Create user management endpoints
3. Connect frontend to authenticated backend endpoints
4. Implement project CRUD operations with backend
5. Set up Celery for task queue
6. Implement real-time updates with WebSocket

## Summary

We have successfully completed the foundational UI components for Bldr Empire v2, including:
- Authentication system (UI complete)
- Project management interface
- Task queue monitoring
- Settings configuration panel
- Responsive design with theme support

The next phase will focus on backend integration to make these components fully functional with real data and authentication.

This file will be updated as implementation progresses.
