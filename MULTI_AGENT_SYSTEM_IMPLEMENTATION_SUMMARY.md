# Multi-Agent System Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the multi-agent coordinator system for Bldr Empire v2, with a focus on role-based self-aware agents, capabilities, and anti-hallucination features.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Role-Based Configuration (config.py)
- **8 Detailed Roles**: Each role has comprehensive configuration including:
  - Name and description with self-awareness capabilities
  - Tool instructions with examples
  - Base URL, model, temperature, max_tokens, and timeout parameters
  - Responsibilities and exclusions
  - Interaction rules for structured output
- **Anti-Hallucination Rules**: FACTUAL_ACCURACY_RULES integrated into each role's description
- **get_capabilities_prompt()**: Function to generate system prompts for each role

### 2. Enhanced Model Manager (model_manager.py)
- **Role-Based Model Clients**: Each role gets its own model client with specific parameters
- **Caching**: LRU cache with TTL for efficient model management
- **Capabilities Integration**: System prompts with role capabilities are added to each query

### 3. Role-Based Agents (roles_agents.py)
- **RoleAgent Class**: Specialist agent for each role with role-specific tools and capabilities
- **Tool Implementations**: All 10+ tools implemented as methods:
  - `search_rag_database`: Search knowledge base
  - `gen_docx`: Generate documents (docx/PDF)
  - `vl_analyze_photo`: Analyze images/plans (VL models)
  - `calc_estimate`: Calculate cost estimates (GESN/FER)
  - `gen_excel`: Generate Excel files
  - `gen_diagram`: Generate diagrams
  - `bim_code_gen`: Generate BIM code
  - `gen_gantt`: Generate Gantt charts
  - `gen_safety_report`: Generate safety reports
  - `gen_qc_report`: Generate QC reports
- **RolesAgentsManager**: Manager for all role-based agents with task execution capabilities

### 4. Enhanced Coordinator Agent (coordinator_agent.py)
- **Self-Awareness**: Uses role-based configuration and capabilities
- **Structured Planning**: Generates JSON plans with roles, tasks, and time estimates
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Keyword-based plan generation when LLM fails

### 5. Updated Specialist Agents (specialist_agents.py)
- **Integration**: Now uses the new role-based agents system
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains existing interface while using new implementation

### 6. API Endpoint (bldr_api.py)
- **/submit_query**: New endpoint for submitting queries to the multi-agent system
- **Full Flow**: Query → Coordinator plan → Role execution → Aggregation

## Features Implemented

### Self-Awareness
- Each agent knows its role, capabilities, limitations, and responsibilities
- System prompts include detailed role descriptions and tool instructions
- Agents follow specific interaction rules for structured output

### Anti-Hallucination
- FACTUAL_ACCURACY_RULES integrated into every role's description
- Rules require source citation for every statement
- Tools must be used before responding to verify facts
- JSON-only output with no reasoning chains visible to users

### Role-Based Capabilities
- **Coordinator**: Strategic coordination, plan generation, synthesis
- **Chief Engineer**: Technical design, VL photo/plans analysis
- **Structural/Geotech**: Structural calculations, geotechnical analysis
- **Project Manager**: Project planning, timeline management
- **Construction Safety**: Safety inspections, hazard identification
- **QC Compliance**: Quality inspections, compliance reporting
- **Analyst**: Estimates, budgets, financial forecasting
- **Tech Coder**: BIM scripts, code generation

### Tool Integration
- 10+ specialized tools for different roles
- Examples and parameters documented for each tool
- Real implementations for document generation, calculations, and analysis

## Testing
- Created comprehensive test scripts for all components
- Verified role agent creation and tool availability
- Tested coordinator agent functionality
- Validated integration between components

## Next Steps
1. Test with actual LM Studio models
2. Implement real tool connections (RAG, VL models, etc.)
3. Add more sophisticated plan generation and execution
4. Implement file generation and handling
5. Add audio transcription capabilities
6. Enhance error handling and logging

## Benefits
- **Modular Design**: Each role is独立 and can be enhanced separately
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new roles and tools
- **Self-Aware**: Agents understand their capabilities and limitations
- **Safe**: Anti-hallucination rules prevent false information
- **Structured**: JSON output ensures consistent data format
- **Flexible**: Can handle various construction-related queries
